        <p>Oh, yeah<br>
            Alright<br>
            Somebody's Heine'<br>
            Is crowdin' my icebox<br>
            Somebody's cold one<br>
            Is givin' me chills<br>
            Guess I'll just close my eyes<br>
            Oh, yeah<br>
            Alright<br>
            Feels good<br>
            Inside<br>
            Flip on the telly<br>
            Wrestle with Jimmy<br>
            Something is bubbling<br>
            Behind my back<br>
            The bottle is ready to blow<br>
            <span>Say it ain't so<br>
            Your drug is a heartbreaker<br>
            Say it ain't so<br>
            My love is a life taker</span><br>
            I can't confront you<br>
            I never could do<br>
            That which might hurt you<br>
            To try and be cool<br>
            When I say<br>
            This way is a waterslide away from me<br>
            That takes her further every day<br>
            So be cool<br>
            <span>Say it ain't so<br>
            Your drug is a heartbreaker<br>
            Say it ain't so<br>
            My love is a life taker</span><br>
            Dear daddy, I write you<br>
            In spite of years of silence<br>
            You've cleaned up, found Jesus<br>
            Things are good, or so I hear<br>
            This bottle of Steven's awakens ancient feelings<br>
            Like father, stepfather<br>
            The son is drowning in the flood<br>
            Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
            <span>Say it ain't so<br>
            Your drug is a heartbreaker<br>
            Say it ain't so<br>
            My love is a life taker</span></p>
